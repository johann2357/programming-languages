Write a C program that does a large number of references to elements
of two-dimensioned arrays, using only subscripting. Write a second
program that does the same operations but uses pointers and pointer
arithmetic for the storage-mapping function to do the array references.
Compare the time efficiency of the two programs. Which of the two
programs is likely to be more reliable? Why?
