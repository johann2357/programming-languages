Write a Perl program that uses a hash and a large number of operations
on the hash. For example, the hash could store peopleâ€™s names and their
ages. A random-number generator could be used to create three-character
names and ages, which could be added to the hash. When a duplicate
name was generated, it would cause an access to the hash but not add a
new element. Rewrite the same program without using hashes. Compare
the execution efficiency of the two. Compare the ease of programming
and readability of the two.

$ perl hash.pl 
It took: 0.01 seconds
$ perl nohash.pl 
It took: 1.75 seconds
